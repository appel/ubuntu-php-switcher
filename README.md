# Ubuntu PHP Switcher
Ubuntu PHP switcher is a simple script to switch your Apache and CLI configs quickly between major versions of PHP.

If you support multiple products/projects that are built using either brand new or old legacy PHP functionality and you find it a pain to change config files continually this will make the whole process just one command.

## Caveats

For use with Ubuntu (not tested on other linux systems). For OSX php switching, I recommend [brew php switcher by phil cook](https://github.com/philcook/brew-php-switcher).

This does not check the validity of the version or if it exists.
